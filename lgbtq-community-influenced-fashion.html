    <p class="blog_main">There are a large number of gay fashion designers that have definitely influenced modern fashion and without them, your wardrobe would look completely different to what it is today.   </p>

    <p class="blog_main">Gianni Versace has without doubt transformed fashion and this is because he was one of the first designers who took inspiration from his life and art. His brand is one of the most recognized labels in the fashion world and is worth $1.7 billion. Gianni  was with his partner, Antonio D’Amico, for 15 years before he was murdered on the steps of his mansion. Versace has created a number of extremely famous designs, such as the Baroque Print, the Bondage Collection and the jungle green dress warm by Jennifer Lopez that inspired the creation of Google images.    </p>

    <h3 class="blog_main_big"><u><strong>GAY ICONS </strong></u></h3>

    <p class="blog_main">The LGBTQ+ community has been the home countless fashion icons, such Elton John, Freddie Mercury and Cher, to name a few. These icons have changed the way that people dress by showing them that you can express yourself through bold outfit choices and bright colours. They have shown the world their unique outfits and costumes, such as Elton John’s iconic white feather suit, and inspired people to show the world who they really are.      </p>

    <h3 class="blog_main_big"><u><strong>3 FASHION RULES FROM THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY </strong></u></h3>

    <p class="blog_main">The LGBTQ+ community stereotypically has good fashion sense so here are some fashion rules that have been suggested by the community.     </p>

    <p class="blog_main">One of the rules is to make sure that your clothing fits you. This doesn’t mean that you can’t wear an oversized sweater, you just need to make sure that it fits right and doesn’t look like you have accidently ordered the wrong size jumper.     </p>

    <p class="blog_main">Another rule is to embrace patterns, they are perfect for adding “a bit of gay flair to an outfit”. Every man should have at least one patterned shirt or t-shirt that they can wear to spice up one of their more dull outfits.     </p>

    <img src="prada pattern.png" width="960" height="540" class="centre" alt="Prada patterned shirts" style="padding-top: 0;">  
    <small class="blog_copyright">http://popcornfashion.com/?tag=prada&paged=2</small>

    <p class="blog_main">The final rule is to stay away from sleeveless shirts, the only exception for this rule is if you have big, toned arms. If you wear a tank top and have small arms then it will do you no favours and will make you look skinny and weaker than you actually are. </p>

    <p class="blog_main">As you can see, the LGBTQ+ community has had an incredible influence of modern fashion and without some of the help from gay fashion designers, modern fashion would look completely different to what it is today. Some other gay fashion designers that were incredibly influential are: Tom Ford, Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier, Valentino and Alexander Wang. There are definitely a lot more LGBTQ+ designers that I have missed off my list so Tweet us @fredsfashion if you think we should add any more to the list!
