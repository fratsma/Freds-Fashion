    <p class="blog_main">2020 hasn’t been the best year for fashion, with clothing sales dropping by around 50% due to the CODIV-19 outbreak. But this doesn’t mean that there still can't be some great trends to arrive this year. In this blog post, I will be going over some of the biggest and best men’s designer fashion trends to surface in 2020. </p>

    <h3 class="blog_main_big"><u><strong>Tucked In</strong></u></h3>

    <p class="blog_main">The tucked in look has many different forms, such as the French tuck that Tan from Queer Eye seems to love so much. Each type of tuck has a different place in fashion, from the effortless and casual half tuck, which is perfect for t-shirts. To the full tuck, which is perfect for a more tailored and smart look. This fashion trend has been around for ages, however it has gained more popularity in 2020 with more and more celebrities pulling off different methods of shirt tucks.  </p>

                <h3 class="description_font_big"><strong><u>Pastel Colours</u></strong></h3>
                <p class="description_font">Pastel colours give the perfect summery vibes when paired with a pair of shorts or chinos. This can be clothing such as a pastel pink shirt to a pastel mint green t-shirt. Men wearing dull and boring colours is a thing of the past and is meant for the older generations. Pastel colours are also perfect to add a bit of adventure to a plain outfit. For example, a pastel t-shirt will pair perfectly with a pair of black jeans and a jacket because it will contrast nicely with the black and make it stand out more</p>

    <h3 class="blog_main_big"><u><strong>Man Bags</strong></u></h3>

    <p class="blog_main">Cross body bags can be both stylish and practical. Perfect for storing items such as you phone and wallet, and it can be more useful than just your pockets. You can get one of these bags from basically any fashion designer, from Louis Vuitton and Prada to Tommy Hilfiger and Guess. There are also many different styles of bag that you can choose from such as messenger bag, cross body bags and shoulder bags. My personal favourite is the shoulder bag because of the shape, it is a rectangle but has a more fixed shape and isn’t too bulky (as can be seen from the Alexander McQueen here). I have personally tried out this bag and it is honestly one of the nicest bags I have ever seen.   </p>

                <h3 class="description_font_big"><strong><u>Designer Denim Jackets</u></strong></h3>
                <p class="description_font">Denim jackets have been around for way over 100 years, however, designer jackets have gained popularity in 2020. More often than not, these jackets have been detailed with a brand’s logo across the back. One particular brand that I have been seeing rather a lot of is Balmain. Their jackets have a 3d textured logo on the back which adds a trendy touch to.  They come in a range of different colours, such as: black, some different shades of blue and grey. However, the only issue with Balmain’s denim jackets is that they carry a hefty price tag of between £600 and £1000. If you are looking for a more reasonably priced piece of denim, then Ami Paris is the place for you. From one of my favourite designers, Ami Paris do a really nice deep blue jacket with an Ami Paris Patch on the back. Written in a 80’s American baseball style, this is a lovely jacket for all occasions.</p>

    <h3 class="blog_main_big"><u><strong>Funky Shirts</strong></u></h3>

    <p class="blog_main">As aforementioned, a bit of colour is really in at the moment and for this reason funky shirts are popular with the younger generation. This can range from a floral pattern to a bowling shirt. Designers such as Dolce & Gabbana and Valentino were seen on the runway with bold and colourful designs. These shirts are perfect for summer time and can be worn either fully buttoned up or half open and pair perfectly with either plain or colourful shorts. This Dolce and Gabbana shirt features colourful parrots and is perfect for a party in the sun.

    <p class="blog_main">Fashion trends are constantly evolving and developing, whether we are in lockdown or not. But the most important part of your own personal style is to make sure that you are comfortable in the clothes you are wearing and make sure you wear it with confidence. Because at the end of the day, even if you are wearing one of the trendiest items around, if you aren’t wearing it with confidence and are uncomfortable in it then you won’t be able to pull it off. I hope you have enjoyed this blog post and learned some useful fashion tips.
