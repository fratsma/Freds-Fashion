    <h2>A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO JAPANESE STREETWEAR</h2>

    <br>

    <img src="japanese streetwear.jpg" width="960" height="720" class="centre" alt="Japanese Streetwear" style="padding-top: 0;">


    <h3 class="blog_main_big"><u><strong>The Origins </strong></u></h3>

    <p class="blog_main">The origin of Japanese street wear dates back as far as the 70s/80s, when
        Japanese youth, for the first time, was standing up against their elders. Their
        mindset now rebellious, non conforming and defiant. By the 90s a lot of these
        young people had moved in an attempt to start a new away from traditional
        families. A small neighbourhood called Urahara, placed between Harajuku and
        Ayoama in Shibuya, Tokyo was popular for its cheap rent and became home to a
        lot of youth in this type of situation. From then, many boutiques started to pop
        up, offering new styles not yet seen, influenced by western fashion. </p>

        <p class="blog_main"><strong>Boutiques: NOWHERE and A Store Robot</strong></p> 

        <p class="blog_main">It didn’t take long for popularity to grow, everyone wanted to buy and wear this
            new aesthetic, getting exposure in magazines such as ‘Fruits’ that shaped the
            style. </p>

    <small class="blog_copyright">https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/29001/1/fruits-future-pop-fashion</small>


    <p class="blog_main">The publication helped bring the fluid, flamboyant, and fresh aesthetics of
        Japanese youth culture to the world. However, Aoki discontinued the
        publication in 2017 claiming there were “no more fashionable kids to 
        photograph”. </p>

    <p class="blog_main">You can see pictures from the magazine as Tokyo-based editor Chris Tordoff
        decided to dedicate an Instagram to it. Called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fruits_magazine_archives/">@fruits_magazine_archives</a>, the
        page gives the publication a new lease of digital life. </p>

    <h3 class="blog_main_big"><u><strong>The Aesthetic </strong></u></h3>

    <p class="blog_main">We could say that the Harajuku aesthetic commonly uses looser fitting, vintage
        inspired garments, and modernized Japanese garments. it simply cannot be
        defined by this surface level analysis. Harajuku is much more about a state of
        mind than an item of clothing. Most brands were born out of a misfit mentality,
        pushing their desire to dress different, and live different from the traditional
        families and culture they were born into. Attempts at trying to pinpoint a
        definite style would be useless, as the clothes are only a means to a bigger
        picture. Each brand interprets and reflects the rebellious/youthful mentality in a
        unique way.</p>

    <h3 class="blog_main_big"><u><strong>Designers</strong></u></h3>

    <p class="blog_main"><strong>TOKKOU</strong></p>


    <p class="blog_main"> (Japanese term tokkō-fukku)
        ‘Special attack clothing’
        Japanese-born, London-based fashion brand owned by Masa. He draws
        inspiration from the Bousou-zoku subculture, which involves biker gangs in the
        80s. Masa believes this culture is disappearing, which is why he wants to
        emulate its legacy through his brand. TOKKOU is known for its famous
        Okayama denim and punk-like embroidered phrases – such as the roughly
        translated “Unify a country” and “Not giving up.”</p>

    <p class="blog_main"><strong>UNDERCOVER</strong></p>


    <p class="blog_main">Their motto, “We make noise, not clothes.” explains their design philosophy
        -rebellion and disruption are at its core. Jun Takahashi, the label’s founder,
        blends pop culture with punk aesthetics to create what is one of the more
        influential Japanese streetwear brands today</p>
